# Data Model Visual App

## Overview
This project aims to build an app similar to [draw.io](https://draw.io), offering powerful visual diagram editing. It also takes inspiration from [swimlanes.io](https://swimlanes.io), where users can create sequence diagrams by writing markdown-like text. Our app combines both approaches, integrating a powerful AI assistant that allows users to either edit diagrams visually or describe their intentions in natural language or markdown-style text to generate and modify diagrams.

## Key Features
- **Diagram Editing:** Users can create and edit diagrams visually, just like in draw.io.
- **AI Chat Assistant:** Users can describe their intentions or diagram changes in natural language (text messages), and the AI will help generate, modify, or explain diagram elements.
- **Markdown/Text-Based Diagrams:** Inspired by swimlanes.io, users can write markdown-like text to quickly create sequence diagrams or other diagram types.
- **Hybrid Workflow:** Users can freely switch between manual editing and AI-driven or text-based commands, making diagramming faster and more intuitive.

## Example Use Case
- A user starts drawing a flowchart.
- Instead of manually adding every element, the user types:
  > “Add a swimlane for the QA team and connect it to the deployment process.”
- Or, the user writes markdown-like text to define a sequence diagram.
- The AI assistant interprets the message or markdown and updates the diagram accordingly.

This approach combines the flexibility of manual diagramming with the speed and intelligence of AI-driven and text-based design.
